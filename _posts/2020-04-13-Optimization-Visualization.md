post_description: The motivation of this blog, developped by my friend <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/corentin-carteau-80a827144/">Corentin CARTEAU</a> and myself, is to build intuition about the behaviour of state of the art optimization algorithms in the face of particular loss shapes. Our interactive simulator includes first order (Gradient Descent-like methods) and second order (Newton-like) methods on a wide range of test functions (Scale inhomogeneity, Local Minima, Non-Stationary functions...).
