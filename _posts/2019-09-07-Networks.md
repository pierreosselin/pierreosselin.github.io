title: Efficient community detection in sparse networks with non-backtracking random walkers
post_description: This post present the report of my mini project of the course "Networks" at the university of Oxford. It deals with the apparent lack of performance of community detection of classical spectral methods and present the operators introduced in the litterature to overcome this problem.
