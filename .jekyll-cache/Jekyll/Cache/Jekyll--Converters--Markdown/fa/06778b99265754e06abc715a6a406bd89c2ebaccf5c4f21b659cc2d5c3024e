<p>The task of detecting communities on undirected networks has attracted much attention in the past decades thanks to the progress of computational power. Spectral methods, techniques based on the study of eigenvalues and eigenvectors of particular matrices, represent one possible avenue to solve this problem. However, “classic” processes based on the adjacency matrix and related matrices such as the normalized laplacian or the modularity matrix, fail to perform this task on “sparse” networks, which depict a common type of network. In this paper we illustrate this issue and review a spectral method based on the “non-backtracking” matrix, that is more suited for this type of network, as well as other alternative matrices. We quantify the performance of those methods on artificial generated networks and real data sets.</p>
